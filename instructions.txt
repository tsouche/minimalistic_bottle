# Buil and publish a python docker image which can be used for this project

We use the official docker Python image: "python:latest" (i.e. at the moment
of writing, the Python 3.7.4 version).

We also need to secure that the build tools are available. We need pip:

$ sudo apt-get install python3-pip


Actions to build the image, the corresponding docker and publishing it to the 
public registry:

# build the image

$ docker build -t simpleserver .

# run the container (to test the server)

$ docker run -d -p 8080:8080 simpleserver


# Test to the server:

$ curl http://localhost:8080/
$ curl http://localhost:8080/hello/
$ curl http://localhost:8080/about/

# Upload the docker image

$ docker login

# tag properly the image 

$ docker tag simpleserver tsouche/setserver:basic

# and now publish the image

$ docker push tsouche/setserver:basic


It is now possible to fetch the image directly from the docker public registry:

$ docker run -d -p 8080:8080 tsouche/setserver:basic
